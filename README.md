# Python Learning

A repo, where I try my best to self-educate how to write basic code on Python.

OK repo - [here](https://github.com/fmipython/PythonCourse2024)

Python Original Site(Tutorials) - [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)

"""After this Py course I will consider myself on a intermediate level, nothing too fancy / basic knowledge about Py"""
